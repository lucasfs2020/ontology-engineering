## Abstract

This is the preliminary project page for the Course Recommender ontology engineering project.

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can recommended courses for an RPI student to enroll in for the next semester. To enable this system, our team is constructing an ontology that can capture information about courses, a student's plan-of-study, topic areas of courses, and graduation requirements.

This project and its core use case are currently under active development. More information about the most up-to-date documents related to the ontology and associated artifacts can be found in the list of resources.
