## Abstract

Everyone loves great movies, but finding them can be difficult at times. Most (if not all) streaming services have their own way of providing recommendations, but these are limited only to their own services, so you won’t get recommendations on Netflix based on your watch history on Hulu. By joining watch history across multiple streaming providers and creating recommendations through an ontology in an explainable way, users could get an even better series of recommendations.

The main sources of general data for this system will be IMDB and other movie rating sites. The personalized data will come from the user’s watch history, tracked by the system.
