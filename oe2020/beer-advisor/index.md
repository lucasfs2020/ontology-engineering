## Abstract
Beer is said to be one of the oldest alcoholic drinks created by humans. In fact, we have been creating different types of beers for millennia and, hence, due to the wide variety of beers with different flavor profiles and styles, choosing a beer is not a simple matter. There are also many people who are picky about what they drink, as they may not like certain styles of beer. There can also be the concerns of alcohol content and brewery location, as people want to support their local beer scene. In this context, the Beer Advisor helps people in the difficult task which is finding the perfect beer. The application combines information from different databases in order to find the perfect beer match considering the user's requests.
