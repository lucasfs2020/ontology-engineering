## Abstract
The goal of this project is to provide the tools to assess the nutritional/lifestyle needs of a diabetic patient. We would do this by developing an ontology-enabled application that would use the ontology to answer patient questions based on the recommendations detailed in the authoritative literature in the diabetes domain, the Standards of Medical Care, Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) released by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The ontology should also match them to the guidelines that are relevant to them.
