## Pokemon-Moveset-Application Team
Mitchell Falkow, Jay Franklin, Zhepeng Luo, John Slowik

## Abstract
Not all moves can be acquired by all Pokémon, and not all moves a Pokémon can learn are available through all avenues. The goal is to create an ontology that simplifies the acquisition of Pokémon builds. When considering a Pokémon team, players analyze the movesets that each Pokémon on the team will use, and how to obtain that moveset. However, the process of figuring out how to create a specific Pokémon moveset can get quite complicated, especially if the player needs to chain together several Pokémon to breed in order to give a Pokémon an Egg Move (move only obtainable through breeding). The primary motivation for this project is to create an application to simplify the process of acquiring Pokémon movesets—in particular, acquiring Egg Moves, but also the other kinds of moves that are available to Pokémon.
